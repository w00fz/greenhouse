### Greenhouse Scaffold

The exact same version of the React-based Scaffold, but in TypeScript with a few additional convenient dependencies (ie, Tailwind, Framer Motion), a nice builder (Vite) and the removal of `lodash` dependency.

## Get started

First install the dependencies by running the command:

```sh
npm install
```

To run the app, use the command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
